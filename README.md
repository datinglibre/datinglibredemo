# DatingLibre

![Build Status](https://github.com/datinglibre/datinglibre/actions/workflows/datinglibre.yml/badge.svg)

DatingLibre is an open source white-label dating site platform (implemented as a Symfony bundle). It uses: 
- `PHP` 7.4 or 8.0
- Symfony
- PostgreSQL
- Amazon `SES`
- Amazon `S3` (or a compatible service) 
- Ansible.

DatingLibre is made up of the following repositories:
- the reference implementation (this repository) which uses the test categories `color` and `shape`, and contains the Behat test scenarios.
- the [datinglibre-app-bundle](https://github.com/datinglibre/datinglibre-app-bundle) which contains controllers, repositories, services, entities, database migrations and Behat test contexts.
- the [DatingLibreDemo](https://github.com/datinglibre/DatingLibreDemo) repository, which shows how the `datinglibre-app-bundle` can be 
overridden to build a custom website: overriding functionality as required, whilst leaving the rest of the bundle upgradable via `composer upgrade`. The code in this repository is deployed to the live test site, which can be seen at [datinglibre.com](https://datinglibre.com).
  
All PRs should be opened against this reference repository and/or the [datinglibre-app-bundle](https://github.com/datinglibre/datinglibre-app-bundle).
